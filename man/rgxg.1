greater than or equal FIRST. The numbers must be positive and given in base-10
notation.

.B Options

Generate the regular expression for the number range with base BASE. The
BASE must be in the range between 2 and 32. The default base is 10.

\-N
Omit the outer parentheses, if any, of the regular expression. This
option can be useful if the generated regular expression is used within
another alternation.

.TP
\-l
For bases greater than 10 only match lower case letters. By default both
lower and upper case letters are matched.
